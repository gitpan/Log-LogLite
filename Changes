Revision history for Perl extension Log::LogLite.

0.8  Thu Jan  3 14:57:22 CET 2002
       - For the new year, I got lucky, and found out the obvious: 
	 there is a function called "caller" build in Perl. 
	 So no more use of the annoying Devel::CallerItem! 
         Besides, I upgraded the VERSION number to 0.8, because we 
	 use this class for quite a time now, and had no problems.

       - OK, now it is written correctly - the log file is opened when
         we construct the object. It is locked everytime we write into
         it, and it is closed in the destructor. Thanks Rob Napier for
         guiding me to do it that way.
